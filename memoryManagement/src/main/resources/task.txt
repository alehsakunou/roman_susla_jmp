Part #1
Design and implement code that will introduce:

    java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space. Create big objects continuously and make them stay in memory.
    java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space. Load classes continuously and make them stay in memory.
    java.lang.StackOverflowError.

Use options like -XX:MaxPermSize=1m -Xmx10m to reach exception quicker.
